# Tic-Tac-Toe

A retro twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe for those who enjoy the sights and sounds of the early 90's.

## How it was built

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to build this game.

## Features

* Street Fighter theme
* Multi screen game
    * Menu
    * Options
    * Player Select
    * Match-up
    * Game
* Different audio for each screen
* Options:
    * Gameboard size
    * Number of games (i.e Best of 3)
    * Turn music on/off


## Planning
I started with mapping out the logic of Tic-Tac-Toe and writing pseudo-code to gain an understanding of how the game can be won.

Once basic functionbality was implemented, I created a wireframe of the Street Fighter menu and player select screens and commenced adding styles to each screen, then implemented additional Javascript to connect each screen.
